            Our mission is to provide users with a concise method of
            symptom-tracking by promoting medical self-advocacy to combat
            maternal mortality rates.

              The benefits of effective self-advocacy include improved
              person-centered care and quality of life, and reduced symptom
              burden and use of preventative health services (Thomas et al.,
              Citation2021)

              information suggested that Black women are less likely to share
              information with healthcare providers compared to other
              ethnic/racial groups.

              In currently under-researched areas, healthcare professionals
              (HCPs) and other patients stand to benefit from an improved
              understanding of patient perspectives
