            Our mission is to provide users with a concise method of
            symptom-tracking by promoting medical self-advocacy to combat
            maternal mortality rates.

              The benefits of effective self-advocacy include improved

              burden and use of preventative health services (Thomas et al.,

              According to a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh,
              information suggested that Black women are less likely to share
              information with healthcare providers compared to other
              ethnic/racial groups.

              In currently under-researched areas, healthcare professionals
              (HCPs) and other patients stand to benefit from an improved
